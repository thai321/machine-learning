# Classification

## Logistic Regression


## K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN):
>+ `Step 1`: choose the number K of neighbors
>+ `Step 2`: Take the K nearest neighbors of the new data oint, according to the Euclidean distance
>+ `Step 3`: Among these K neighbors, count the number of data points in each category
>+ `Step 4`: Assign the new data point to the category where you counted the most neighbors
>+ `Your Model is Ready`
